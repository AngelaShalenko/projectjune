Redesign JuneHypnoBirthing website

Learning front end web development by building my business website from scratch to make it 
better than my current wordpress template site (JuneHypnoBirthing.com)

I want the new design to be more reflective of my style, more responsive, and easier to read and 
use for my clients.
